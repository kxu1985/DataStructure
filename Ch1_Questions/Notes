Java:
    main() can directly call static method of the class

    Two ways to check permutation:
    1. sort and then compare string.equals
    2. compare the number of letters

    String is immutable, which means you cannot change the Object created in place

    Q4. needs to implement using char array.
    The other thing is str.toCharArray() creates a new Object so if we want to copy
    char array we need to use System.arraycopy().

    Q5. If a string needs to be changed, use StringBuffer
