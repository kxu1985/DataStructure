Stack and Queue:

    If implement using singly linked list:

    Difference:
        Stack: only needs one reference pointing to the top
        Queue: needs two references- one points to the first and the other points to the last

    Common:
        For incoming a new item (Push for Stack and Enqueue for Queue) no return value;
        For outgoing an item (Pop for Stack and Dequeue for Queue) need to return the Node Object;
