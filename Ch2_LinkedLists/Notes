Singly Linked List:
    Add a node == append a node to the tail
    Pseudo code:
        Node end = new Node(data);
        Node n = this;
        while (n.next != null) n = n.next;
        n.next = end

    Print the list: the trick is to print the tail node
    Pseudo code:
        int index = 0
        while (current.next != null)
        {
            index = index + 1;
            print current node;
            current = current.next;
        }
        if (current.next == null) 
        // include the cases of both one-node list and ending node 
        {
            index = index + 1;
            print current node;
        }
